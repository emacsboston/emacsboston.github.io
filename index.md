### We're the Emacs meetup in Boston!

We get together once a month or so (we're currently aiming for the
first Monday of the month). We have some pizza and drinks and listen
to an Emacs-related talk or two. Fun times are had by all. =)

Talks are recorded. We post the videos on YouTube for streaming. We
also release the [videos for download] in a free format.

Announcements of new meetings and talk descriptions are posted on our
[meetup.com group]. We also cross-post them here on our blog, if you
prefer RSS and/or don't want to get a meetup.com account.

The group is sponsored by [thoughtbot], which provides the pizza,
beer, and space.

### Who's doing this?

I'm [Harry Schwartz], a developer and Emacs enthusiast from
[thoughtbot]'s Boston office.
