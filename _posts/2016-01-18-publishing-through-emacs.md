[Aaron Bello] will be speaking about publishing books, articles, and slides from
Emacs:

> I use Emacs for almost everything on my computer, including reading email,
> compiling programs, twitter, blogging, IRC chat, my agenda, and performing a
> variety of other tasks.
>
> We will cover how to use Emacs to create an ebook and scale the ebook we
> produce to books, articles, presentation slides and journals.
