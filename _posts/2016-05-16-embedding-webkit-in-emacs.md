[Aaron Conole][] will be speaking about embedding webkit in Emacs:

> In this talk we will cover the XWidgets work that has been merged into Emacs
> master. We'll go over the build options and dependencies to enable XWidgets,
> some of the Elisp calls required to view a page using webkit, and what the
> future might look like. Finally, a live demo of webkit browsing within Emacs
> will be shown.
