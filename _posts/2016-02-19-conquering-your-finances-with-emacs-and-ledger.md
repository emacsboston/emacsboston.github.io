[Austin Walker][]

> [Ledger][] is a command line accounting tool for Linux, Mac, and Windows.
> Transactions are stored in a simple text format, so your data is available
> wherever you can use a text editor. My editor of choice is Emacs using
> ledger-mode, which offers autocompletion for account names and other useful
> functions. I currently manage about 5 years of my own financial data with
> Ledger, and I plan to continue for many years to come!
