Another month, another Emacs meetup! This month Paul Michael Reilly will be
giving us a talk on *Using Emacs with Apple Keyboards:*

> Apple laptop hardware, while expensive, provides extremely high-quality
> processor, storage, and display capabilities. It's the go-to hardware for
> heavy-duty developers across the planet. But there's one area where PC
> hardware remains unsurpassed by Apple: keyboards. The Apple keyboard is
> notoriously bad from an ergonomics perspective, as my experience using Emacs
> on various MacBook Pro laptops attests. Many solutions are suggested for the
> Emacs diehard on Apple short keyboards, but none that I found were
> satisfactory. In this talk I'll chronicle the path I took to achieve a
> pain-free experience using standard Mac keyboards at home, on the train, and
> in the office.
