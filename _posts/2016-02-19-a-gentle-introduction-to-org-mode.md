[Harry Schwartz] will be demonstrating some of the nifty features of [Org mode]:

> Org mode is an outliner, markup language, task manager, calendar, contact
> manager, and who-knows-what-else. I use it to write documents and
> presentations, manage my todo list, and I even write my Emacs configuration in
> it.
>
> In other words, Org is taking over my life.
>
> I'll be introducing some of the functionality of Org, demonstrating what it
> can do, and showing how you, too, can become pleasantly obsessed with a wacky,
> overgrown outlining tool.
