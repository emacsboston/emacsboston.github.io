[Harry Schwartz] will be discussing how we might tempt users of other editors to
the One True Way:

> The out-of-the-box Emacs experience isn't great for new users. There's no
> syntax highlighting, they have to type "yes" to confirm actions, and their
> repos are suddenly littered with files ending with "`~`".
>
> There are some great projects to make Emacs more approachable. [Prelude]
> provides a terrific selection of preconfigured packages, and [Spacemacs]
> offers a great onramp for users coming from Vim. I'm not crazy about those,
> though; I kinda feel like they "magically" do too much, and that they might
> not encourage exploration and modification in the same way that Emacs
> generally does.
>
> I recently created [sensible-defaults.el] as an alternative. It's a minimal
> set of configuration changes and keybindings: just enough to knock off some of
> the unnecessarily-sharp edges. A user can use as much or as little of it as
> they'd like, and it's very amenable to tweaking and customization.

### The Key-signing Party

In addition to the talk, we'll also be having our First Annual Holiday
[Key-signing Party]! Bring along a PGP key and a photo ID if you'd like to
participate. If you'd like to get started with PGP, try reading [PGP and You]
and creating a key before the event. We'll help you out with the signing and
whatnot.
