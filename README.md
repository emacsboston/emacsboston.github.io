## The EmacsBoston Website

This is a standard Jekyll site hosted on GitHub. If you'd like to
suggest any changes to the site, please feel free to file an issue or
submit a pull request!

We pretty shamelessly cloned this repo/site from [EmacsNYC]. Trust me,
they're cool with it. =)

#### This site's not in org-mode! You guys are phonies!

Yeah. It's not. We might do a refactor one of these days!

#### Licensing and stuff

Feel free to fork this repo and use it to help bootstrap your own
meetup! It's licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0], so you can build on it and
tweak it to your heart's content so long as you release your changes,
too.
