### Wanna give a talk?

Perfect, we're looking for speakers! If you have an idea for a talk that the
Emacs community would enjoy, let us know! Whether you're re-implementing the
elisp garbage collector or you've just got a cool workflow in Org, we'd love to
hear from you.

We've got a little [speakers' guide][] that we've assembled to help you prepare
your talk and to help you prepare your machine for screencasting. Please give it
a read! If you have any particular requirements or preferences, we'll do our
best to satisfy them. This should be fun!

Sometimes people are interested in giving a talk, but don't know what to talk
*about.* If you're in that category, we've got a few suggestions for topics we'd
love to learn about:

* Demystifying terminal emulation: `shell` vs `term` vs `ansi-term` vs `eshell`
* Designing and writing a color scheme
* How does syntax highlighting work?
* "Why my `org-mode` workflow is the best"
* Setting up email: `offlineimap`, `gpg`, `authinfo` files, etc
* Writing your first mode
* VCS and/or Magit
* Emacs Speaks Statistics
* Interacting with inferior processes
* `calc`: it can do, like, everything
* Organizing people with PIM functionality: `org-contact`, `bbdb`, etc
* Some advanced elisp techniques
* Lisp macros
* Advanced features of keyboard macros
* Alternative extension languages
* Nifty tricks with `dired`
* Font management
* Contributing to the GNU Emacs project
* Time tracking with `org-mode`
* Interfacing with Trello with `org-trello`
* History of Emacs (Lisp machines, rms, GNU, etc.)
* Using Tramp and SSH
* Blogging with `org-mode`
* Managing packages with Cask and Pallet
* "How I use Emacs with \[my language of choice\]"
* AUCTeX
* Emacspeak
* Remote pairing with Emacs
* CEDET
